### Japonicus [<img src="github-mark.png" width="15">](https://github.com/Gab0/japonicus)

A genetic algorithm system developed to evolve crypto trading bot strategies.
It used the famous [Gekko]() bot.

There is a plan to convert it into a multi-purpose genetic algorithm framework.

### autoGromacs [<img src="github-mark.png" width="15">](https://github.com/Gab0/auto-gromacs)

A pipeline to coordinate GROMACS molecular dynamics runs and analyze mutation effects on protein structures.

### straintables [<img src="github-mark.png" width="15">](https://github.com/Gab0/straintables)

A pipeline that extracts primer-bound regions from a set of intraspecies genomes.

Also capable of rendering distance matrices that represent differences between extracted sequences.

### Antigen Analysis Protocol [<img src="github-mark.png" width="15">](https://github.com/Gab0/toxo-immunodiagnosis-protocol)

An analysis protocol to compare structural differences in immunogenic proteins used in immunoassay diagnosis kits.

This protocol is part of a study that tries to improve immunodiagnosis methods used in clinical evaluation of suspected toxoplasmosis patients.

### BioMedMap [<img src="github-mark.png" width="15">](https://github.com/Gab0/biomedmap)

A system to extract information from multiple research articles and
break down the critical parts to the user. 

Capable of creating information graphs on perceived interactions between biomedical entities. 

Runs on top of existing biomedical NLP engines such as Indra and Reach.

### Lampreia Engine [<img src="github-mark.png" width="15">](https://github.com/Gab0/lampreia-engine)

A relatively fast chess engine written in C with multiple
parameters that can be evolved by genetic algorithms.

### SpeciesPedia [<img src="github-mark.png" width="15">](https://github.com/Gab0/species-pedia)

A page where users can find information on biological species by species name. 

Additionally, there is a taxonomy game that might be fun and educative.

### ABNTMount [<img src="github-mark.png" width="15">](https://github.com/Gab0/ABNTMount)

A system that builds complex ABNT-formatted documents from smaller sections,
which are split across multiple files. It uses LaTeX and ABNTex2.

ABNT is a set of document formatting guidelines that is enforced by brazilian
academic institutions in academic documents such as BsC, MsC and PhD theses.
