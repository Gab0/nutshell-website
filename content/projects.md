### straintables [<img src="github-mark.png" width="15">](https://github.com/Gab0/straintables)

A pipeline that extracts primer-bound regions from a set of intraspecies genomes.

Also capable of rendering distance matrices that represent differences between extracted sequences.

### Antigen Analysis Protocol [<img src="github-mark.png" width="15">](https://github.com/Gab0/toxo-immunodiagnosis-protocol)

An analysis protocol to compare structural differences in immunogenic proteins used in immunoassay diagnosis kits.

This protocol is part of a study that tries to improve immunodiagnosis methods used in clinical evaluation of suspected toxoplasmosis patients.

### BioMedMap [<img src="github-mark.png" width="15">](https://github.com/Gab0/biomedmap)

A system to extract information from multiple research articles and
break down the critical parts to the user. 

Capable of creating information graphs on perceived interactions between biomedical entities. 

Runs on top of existing biomedical NLP engines such as Indra and Reach.
